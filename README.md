# Recipe Recommendation System

This project implements a recipe recommendation system content based on user-provided ingredients. The system utilizes cosine similarity and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to suggest recipes similar to the user's input.

## Overview

The recipe recommendation system allows users to input a list of ingredients, and it recommends recipes from a dataset that match or are similar to the provided ingredients. The recommendations include details such as recipe names, ingredients, nutritional information, images and videos.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommendations are based on the similarity between user-input ingredients and recipes in the dataset.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Calculates similarity scores using cosine similarity metric.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Vectorizes ingredients using TF-IDF for text representation.
